# ecosystem-simulator
A project done for EN-250: Quantitative Biology. It creates organisms with randomly generated attributes and then assigns predator-prey interactions between them. It then can export Species Number, Trophic Links, and Connectance of the Ecosystem, as well as the food pyramid of it. Other auxiliary files combine the data and turn it into a .csv file.
